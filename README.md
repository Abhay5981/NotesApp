# NotesApp
  A simple and dynamic note-taking web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete notes, with all data being stored in the browser's localStorage for     persistence.

## Features
* Create Notes: Users can create new notes dynamically by typing directly into editable fields.
* Edit Notes: All notes are editable, allowing users to modify them on the fly.
* Delete Notes: Notes can be deleted by clicking the delete icon.
* LocalStorage: The app uses localStorage to save notes, so they persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
* Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Technologies Used
* HTML: Structure of the app.
* CSS: Styling and layout of the notes, making the UI clean and user-friendly.
* JavaScript: Handles functionality like adding, editing, deleting notes, and saving them in localStorage.
